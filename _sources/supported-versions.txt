Alfred versions
===============

Alfred-Workflow works with all versions of Alfred 2 and 3, but you must own the
`Powerpack`_ to use Alfred's workflow feature.

All Script Filter features provided by Alfred 2 as of v2.8.3 are supported
in the latest version of Alfred-Workflow.

The :class:`~workflow.workflow.Workflow` class is compatible with both Alfred 2
and Alfred 3. The :class:`~workflow.workflow3.Workflow3` class is only
compatible with Alfred 3.

:class:`~workflow.workflow3.Workflow3` uses Alfred 3's JSON feedback format.
It supports :ref:`workflow variables <workflow-variables>` and more advanced
modifiers than :class:`~workflow.workflow.Workflow`/Alfred 2.


OS X versions
=============

Alfred-Workflow supports the same OS X versions as Alfred 2, namely 10.6 (Snow
Leopard) and later.

.. note::

    :ref:`Notifications`, added in version 1.15 of Alfred-Workflow, are only
    available on Mountain Lion (10.8) and above.


Python versions
===============

Alfred-Workflow supports versions 2.6 and 2.7 of Python. Python 3 is *not*
supported.

Alfred-Workflow is intended to run on the OS X default system Python
(``/usr/bin/python``), which is version 2.6 on OS X 10.6 and 2.7 on all later
versions.

Here is the `full list of new features in Python 2.7`_, but the
most important things if you want your workflow to run on Snow
Leopard/Python 2.6 are:

- :mod:`argparse` is not available in 2.6. Use :mod:`getopt` or
  `include argparse in your workflow`_. Personally, I'm a big fan of
  `docopt`_ for parsing command-line arguments, but :mod:`argparse` is better
  for certain use cases.
- No dictionary views in 2.6.
- No set literals.
- No dictionary or set comprehensions.
- You must specify field numbers for :meth:`str.format`, i.e.
  ``'{0}.{1}'.format(first, second)`` not just
  ``'{}.{}'.format(first, second)``.
- No :class:`~collections.Counter` or
  :class:`~collections.OrderedDict` in :mod:`collections`.

Python 2.6 is still included in later versions of OS X (up to and including
Yosemite), so run your Python scripts with ``/usr/bin/python2.6`` in addition to
``/usr/bin/python`` (2.7) to make sure they will run on Snow Leopard.


Why no Python 3 support?
------------------------

Three-and-a-half big reasons:

1. Python 3 isn't installed by default on any version of OS X.
2. Python 3 doesn't get along well with Alfred 2.
3. Alfred-Workflow is precisely the kind of project that's hard to make
   2- and 3-compatible.
4. Python 2.6 compatiblity is a hard requirement, and writing 2.6- and
   3-compatible code is even harder.

Now that Alfred 3 is available and has some significant new features, there is
*no chance* of this version (1.x.x) of Alfred-Workflow getting Python 3
support, as development has effectively stopped in favour of version 2.

When Python 3 support comes, it will be in version 2 or 3 of the library, which
are targeted at Alfred 3, which eliminates problems 2 and 4.
