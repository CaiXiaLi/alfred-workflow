General:
	- Move workflow into top-level directory to allow use as a Git submodule.
		Is this necessary? I have to copy stuff hither and thither all the time, but
		I'm the one developing the workflow package. Will this be such a problem for
		other developers?

		In this case, where would the docs go? They don't exist yet, but should, and
		including them in the workflow package would be antithetical to what I'm
		trying to achieve. They would just be a duplication of the comments in the
		source code in any case.
